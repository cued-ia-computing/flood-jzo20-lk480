# Flood Warning System Flood Risk Assesment Methodology 

This file outline the assesment methodology for determining the flood risk at towns across the UK.

Polynomial Regression:
To generate a regression line to forecast future water levels we utilised numpy polyfit.
The numpy.poly1d object allows us to obtain the latest water level according to the polynimal regression
line on the day we have specified. 

The polynomial is generated by using a least-squares regression on a set period of historical data. After 
experimenting with different lookback periods, 30 days gave us the most accurate forecast and hence is the default argument to the function. 

Assesment:
To classify the towns for flood risk we utilised the relative water level to compare the latest forecasted level to
the typical high/low range data for each station. We then sorted the stations by the town they were situated in and selected the largest relative water level. 

We then utilised a conditional statement to classify the risk level depending on the magnitude of the relative water level. Thus obtaining a flood risk assesment for all towns in the DEFRA.
